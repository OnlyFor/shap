### ------------ vendored from skimage._shared.utils -------------
# This is a small chunk of code from the skimage package. It is reproduced
# here because all we need is a couple color conversion routines (lab2rgb, lch2lab)
# and adding all of skimage as dependency is really heavy.

    float_type : dtype
        Floating-point dtype for the image.

    This decorator reorders axes for compatibility with functions that only

    Parameters
    ----------
    channel_arg_positions : tuple of int, optional
        Positional arguments at the positions specified in this tuple are
        assumed to be multichannel arrays. The default is to assume only the
        first argument to the function is a multichannel array.
    channel_kwarg_names : tuple of str, optional
        A tuple containing the names of any keyword arguments corresponding to
        multichannel arrays.
    multichannel_output : bool, optional
        A boolean that should be True if the output of the function is not a
        multichannel array and False otherwise. This decorator does not
        currently support the general case of functions with multiple outputs
        where some or all are multichannel.
